# igreader

Hello! This is an Instagram post reader I created for doing giveaways for Thrift Studio Co.

To use it you need a User Access Token, which you can get from the Facebook Graph API Explorer (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer). From there you need to get the desired post's ID.

Outputs:
- comments.txt (total output of all comments (their content) and their timestamps and comment ids
- ids.txt
- names.txt
